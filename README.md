## Spotilyzer

Made with React JS. Lets user log into their Spotify account through [spotilyzer.com](https://spotilyzer.com/), upon login the user is able to look at their profile statistics 
(top 5 tracks, top 5 artists, recently played tracks), they may use a track generator, their saved albums and recommended albums based on their profile info. 

[Material UI](https://mui.com/components/) was used for buttons / dropdowns
[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) was used for the navbar
[React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) was used for the route switches between Home and Profile

# All data is fetched from the Spotify API.

The app uses Spotify's OAuth 2.0 to which the documentation can be [found here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/)
